Advertise Here. Find Out More Reactors Dooms The Nuclear Industry By Yoichi Shimatsu 9-17-16 A murky web of international supply chains is being exposed in the flawed-steel parts scandal rocking the French and Japanese nuclear industries. Serious anomalies have been discovered in key steel components for the European Pressurized Water Reactor (E-PWR) being constructed at Flamanville, France, on the English Channel. The recent exposure of brittle steel has led to a sullen admission by nuclear-tech supplier AREVA of metallurgical defects in at least 400 different types of reactor parts produced by its subsidiary Le Creusot Forge since 1964. Oddly, nearly identical inconsistencies in steel alloys were found in parts imported from Japan for the Flamanville project. Dozens of steel items, which have also been supplied to nuclear plants worldwide, were produced by the Japan Casting and Forging Company (JCFC), a joint venture of three of that nations biggest defense contractors, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metals. Its industrial base in Kitakyushu on the southern island of Kyushu was a major hub of weapons production by Yawata, the forerunner of Nippon Steel, which supplied the Imperial Navy, including the armor for the super-battleship Yamato, and Mitsubishi Aircraft, which built the Zero attack plane. The list of defective steel parts reveals how the allied French and Japanese nuclear industries are now joined at the hip like mutant twins. Mitsubishi and AREVA are partnered in the ATMEA third-generation PWR design program. AREVA is a shareholder in Japan Steel Works, based in northern Hokkaido, a producer of 6-ton single-cast reactor vessels. TEPCO has been allied with AREVA for the decommissioning of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. These interlocking relationships hidden under global marketing campaigns make it difficult to tell where key components are actually sourced. How did Le Creusot Forge evade detection of its defective components for more than two decades? What accounts for the chronic failure of the French and European nuclear-regulatory agencies, along with the UN watchdog IAEA, to properly inspect key parts for the worlds biggest nuclear reactors? Did defective steel have a role in innumerable accidents and leaks at nuclear plants in Japan, Britain, France and the United States? Is endemic bribery of high-ranking politicians and state bureaucrats by the energy industry at the root of a blanket cover-up of radioactive releases and equipment breakdowns at nuclear stations worldwide? While the quick answers are obvious to anyone whos not a nuclear apologist on the secret payroll, further exposure of the ugly details is important toward breaking the code of silence that grips the nuclear sector and large utility companies along with their political flunkies, who together comprise a nuclear mafia that operates exactly like an organized crime family. Meltdowns in the Works Its important to remember that AREVA and Mitsubishi represent the creme de la creme of the global nuclear industry as producers of third-generation PWRS and advanced pressurized water reactors (APWRs). Other major players are still stuck with antiquated systems such as boiling water reactors (BWRs), including Hitachi-GE, Toshiba-Westinghouse, and their Russian and Chinese competitors. These nuclear players, beset with the wreckage at Fukushima, still try to redeem their horrid performance record with slick graphics and fast talk, as if those meltdowns in Japan never happened. If the undisputed technology leaders are covering up hundreds of defective components, then the rest of the pack must be over their heads in production problems and technical failures. The global scale of Areva and Mitsubishis debacle is just one indicator of a grossly inefficient and incompetent global nuclear technology industry. Among the nuclear facilities stuck with shoddy components from Creusot, JCFC and Mitsubishi: Reactor vessel cover heads (RVCH, sealing below and on top of the cylindrical reactor vessel): - 15 reactor closure units in the United States; - 3 units in Sweden - 1 in Brazil - in planning, Hinkley Point in Britain, the Sinop plant in Turkey, a project in Jordan, proposed plant in Indonesia, and 10 planned reactors in Vietnam. Steam Generators (SG), a high-pressure chamber that powers the electricity turbines: - 15 units in France; - 10 units in Belgium, now under guard due to terrorist threats; - 6 units in Mexico JCFC channel heads, which move coolant water into the steam-pressure unit: - 18 reactor vessels at 9 nuclear plants in France; - 13 reactor vesselss at 6 nuclear plants in Japan, including two restarted Mitsubishi reactors at Kyushu Electrics restarted and operational Satsuma-Sendai plant, located near several faults. JCFC also produces 5-ton reactor vessels, which are cast as single block and not welded as in the more vulnerable Chinese and Russian designs. The durability of these PWR vessels, which operate under high temperature and pressure, has been fundamentally challenged by the rapid breech of the much heavier and thicker-walled boiling waters reactors at Fukushima. Mitsubishi had planned to install neutron reflectors to raise efficiency while limiting high-speed particle damage to APWR reactor vessels, but has so far failed to admit how these reflectors can act like beryllium mirrors that intensify chain reactions inside nuclear bombs. Notably, the U.S. Department of Energy withdrew its participation in Mitsubishi APWR development immediately after the Fukushima reactor meltdowns, which proved that nuclear reactors are bombs waiting to be detonated. Zones of Weakness Suspecting quality-control problems at the Flamandville project, lAutorite de Surete Nucleaire (ASN), or French nuclear safety authority, in 2014 ordered AREVA to conduct material tests on its steel components. That occurred seven years after the E-PWR project was started at the existing nuclear plant site in view of Jersey and Guernsey islands and located on the same peninsula as Calais. In April 2015, the ASN announced: The results of these tests revealed the presence of a zone in which there was a high carbon concentration, leading to lower than expected mechanical toughness values. Initial measurements confirmed the presence of this anomaly in the reactor vessel head and reactor vessel bottom head of the Flamanville European Pressurized Reactor (EPR). That is bad news indeed, since it was the top head that got blown off at the Fukushima Dai-ichi No.3 reactor on March 15, 2011, sending a mushroom cloud into the jet stream moving toward North America while showering cascades of metallic micro-pellets containing radioactive isotopes over northern Japan. The bottom head plates of all three melted-down reactors at Fukushima were breached, allowing molten uranium and plutonium to flow like lava into the soil below the plant and subsequently releasing an unstoppable stream of radioactive isotopes into the Pacific Ocean to cause the greatest extinction event in human history. Even though nuclear engineers predict most criticality events in civilian reactors to be less damaging than the Fukushima catastrophe,, the vulnerability of the vessel heads is a serious threat that can wipe out all of Frances agricultural and livestock production overnight, as well as pose a lasting threat to public health across Europe. Chernobyl is proof of that. Not Quite Carbon Copies The mechanical lab tests on the Creusot heads showed 0.22 percent of carbon content in the steel alloy, significantly higher than the 0.16 limit. While a variance of 0.06 percent may not seem like much, it could mean the difference between a near-accident and a reactor breach that ends in a total meltdown. Carbon is the prevalent alloy in the steel-making process. A higher carbon content forms stronger bonds with steel atoms by creating a cubic cage-like structure. As shown in carbon-steel knives, however, an increasing amount of carbon makes hardened steel more brittle. In contrast, low carbon steel is softer but also more ductile. Malleability or toughness (as in resilience) is desirable in pots, kettles and nuclear reactors, since these vessels must expand when heated and shrink while cooled, without breakage or fracturing after repeated use. Pressurized water reactors operate at temperatures of more than 300 Celsius and internal pressures of about one metric ton per square inch. In event of an uncontrolled nuclear reaction, however, both temperature and pressure can rise rapidly. There can also be an additional threat from the Wigner effect of neutron bombardment, which blows apart iron atoms in the crystal matrix of steel. Inside pockmarked steel, radioactive releases hasten a reactor breach. Under sufficient heat and cooling, steel anneals, or rebuilds its crystal structure. But that will not happen during a meltdown due to rising internal temperatures, as shown at Fukushima, ad water-cooling becomes a futile gesture once a reactor is holed. A folk saying often wrongly attributed to King Richard III goes: For want of a nail the shoe was lost. for want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse the rider was lost . . . and so on to the loss of a kingdom. The global nuclear industry is now suffering an avalanche of losses due to a minuscule surplus of 0.06 percent of carbon in steel, sparking a change of events that threatens the future of nuclear power. Complicated Traceability The only publicly stated recommendation from the French nuclear authority was to install a mechanical analysis laboratory inside the Creusot Forge facility in the Saone-et-Loire district. A modern engineering facility like Creusot already has equipment with computer controls and monitoring systems, which have failed to solve the carbon anomalies. Technology may have reached the limits of materials science, and the brittleness program may not be fixable. Omitted from the ASN safety review, AREVA, Le Creusot Forge, JCFC or Mitsubishi is any mention of the underlying cause of the potentially dangerous anomaly in the carbon content of steel components. Exactly where and when in the production process does the metallurgical ratio structure of steel become inconsistent? For people unfamiliar with steel-making, a basic perception problem is rooted in the assumption that steel is impermeable. At the nano-level, however, the lattice of iron is a sponge-like material, which allows passage of gases like oxygen (the cause of rust) and carbon monoxide (which depletes rust). Despite its limitations, no other metal can match the strength and cost-effectiveness of steel. In the steel-making process, carbon is released inside a blast furnace by burning coke, a porous form of coal after its impurities have been removed by intense heat. The burning coke melts the pellets of ion ore. Carbon monoxide gas from coke combustion is reductive(removes oxygen) and restores iron oxide (rust) back into pig iron. Then oxygen is introduced to bond with the carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide, which is then removed from the blast furnace. In the next phase, oxygen lowers carbon levels inside the steel, emitting more carbon dioxide, leaving the end product of low-carbon steel with fairly uniform consistency. It is not possible to maintain uniformity of carbon content through many rounds of reheating. The steel block is repeatedly heated for hot forging, which involves heavy-duty hammering of the metal after it becomes ductile in a gas-fired oven. The forging required for curved reactor vessel covers and channel heads likely puts sufficient stress on the steel to displace carbon atoms. The final results can be affected by the uneven contours of the object and differing densities of the metal, especially where it has been heavily forged, potentially causing displacement of carbon into denser clusters. That at least is a plausible explanation for the carbon anomalies as opposed to the closed-mouth silence from the nuclear industry, which has been totally unable to explain why it produces hundreds of types of products with metallurgical flaws. There are possible industrial design solutions to this morass of failed production techniques, but thats none of my business. Then again, there may be no solution to the fundamental problem of carbon drift in steel-making, at least nothing that is within reasonable cost to a nuclear industry already beset by 300-percent contact overruns at Flamanville. Qualifications at Question Who am I to impudently challenge the entire nuclear establishment over issues of quality-control that are heading toward another Fukushima-scale disaster? One does not have to be a genius to figure out whats wrong with the nuclear industry. My blue-collar competence comes from being a former licensed welder and a millwright (an equipment fixer) at U.S. Steel Southworks in Chicago and also in the seamless tube mill at Republic Steel in Gary, Indiana, where products of large dimension on a massive scale were produced from molten steel to build oil tankers and the Alaska pipeline. Working in the industry can inspire cynicism about corporate assurances of product quality. Once on the midnight shift at the 92-inch plate mill, I witnessed an entire train of defective inch-thick steel clanking back to the steelworks. Instead of lining a super-tanker, the vast stacks of brittle metal was left to rust in a huge pile of scrap. Inspection reports were routinely fudged or completely faked to placate the corporate bosses, whod do anything to fill an order to earn revenues for the near-bankrupt facility. On the other hand, there were outstanding moral examples of otherwise unheralded team leaders and champions of workers rights, but thats another story, which the latecomer to Southside Chicago named Barack Obama knows nothing about. The nearly century-old mill, a vast maze of wreckage on the shore of Lake Michigan where long ore ships from open-pit mines in Minnesota docked, was littered with giant ingots glowing red as they set to cool, the only trustworthy source of heat against the icy winter gusts. Despite the constant risks of injuries and accidental death, metalwork was still practiced as an art by older workers at the fire-spewing ovens, as they judged the readiness of steel in its stages by noticing subtle changes in its glowing hue, faint differences in the smell of its fumes, and the onset of scintillating sparks. My knowledge of steel actually began before then as a weekend blacksmith during university days, when I helped my welding instructor set up forges in an old barn near the rocky site of the fateful war dance of The Prophet Tenskwatawa who emboldened Chief Tecumsahs Shawnee warriors against the encroaching 4th U.S. Infantry in the Indiana territory during the year prior to the War of 1812. Blood and steel on the land that was once the worlds greatest stand of hardwood forest, since decimated down to flat fields of gene-modified corn and soybeans. Although a power hammer was installed in the beamed barn with hard effort, the dull mechanical beast was rarely used since nothing could match the ring of a hammer dropping in rhythmic cadence onto red-hot metal over an anvil. At the forge, my hand turned the rotary bellows to raise blue flames out of the self-made coke, while my eyes stared into that fiery cradle of every civilization that has ever risen and fallen since the start of the Iron Age, from the Hittites and the Mycenaeans of Homer, the Aryan realm of Zoroaster to the Mauryan Empire of the Buddhist king Asoka, to ancient China, Rome, the Arab world and Europe, and culminating in the Industrial Revolution, on down to that very hour when B-52s were mercilessly pummeling Vietnam with tons of ordnance. Steel holds the power over life and death, crafted into swords or ploughshares, and therefore must be imbued with virtue and justice, as pledged by every master swordmaker and authentic gunsmith. Only in our time has a crazed pseudo-scientific priesthood willfully and foolishly violated the sacred union of fire and metal, so that their abominable faith in atom-splitting can be proven in a false cosmology disguised as scientific theory, while bringing devastation upon humanity, from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl and Fukushima, and on until their abuse of technology ends with the total extinction of life on this planet. The demented cult of nuclear believers have since thrown their support behind Shinzo Abe, a minion of the apocalyptic guru of the Aum Shinrikyo cult and his predecessor, the founder of Sukyo Mahikari, Yoshikazu Okada. In an exhortation that resonates in todays defect-ridden global nuclear industry, the militarist Okada urged his followers to plant nuclear bombs everywhere, and to occasionally detonate an atomic explosion to keep lesser peoples in fear and servitude. Every reactor is a time bomb ticking down to zero hour. That heinous injunction, which explains the murderous secrecy of Japans nuclear industry, and for that matter of the entire global nuclear sector, is the only explanation for the installation of defective reactors in more and more countries. Intentional or not, their common endgame is mass death through the spread of radioactivity, sending a plague of cancer everywhere and afterthe Fukushima meltdowns the start of a global extinction event. Theirs is the mad vision of the Final War preached by Shoko Asahara, now apparently pardoned of the death penalty for his role in the gassing 20,000 subway commuters at the morning rush hour in Tokyo, that opening act in this last harvest of souls. Against grotesque lies of the deceivers, along with public indifference and mental servitude, rusted metal must be purged with fire. After iron is refined in smoke and purified in flames to become steel, and metal rod is hammered into blade, then as a thin blue wave ripples toward the tapered edge, ready for quenching with a thrust into cold water, the sword is tempered. Honest men will rise and step forward to their calling so that life might triumph over evil. \n","\n","title:  Nuclear weapons question\n","text:  Report Copyright Violation nuclear weapons question Hello all.. I have been a longtime lurker on this board but this is my first time posting. I have many questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area..In terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldn't there be more of an impact? I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth.. with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once? Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly (with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours) if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter? I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain better.Another question.. I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why it's true. [ link to heiwaco.tripod.com ] Personally I find it's safer to believe they work, if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value. You don't want to question them about it or dare them to prove it!In terms of world 3... have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline? I would be lying if I said I'm not scared. When it comes to death. .it sucks sure but I'm not afraid for myself.. I'm afraid for my one year old! I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful, healthy, long life! I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I can't help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world.. for what? So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3? I just feel so lost and hurt. If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know. The aspect of the end being at our door isn't too much a problem for me.. it's more the aspect that I don't want this for my child! I want her to live her life! Fall in love! See the world!I don't know.. maybe the time isn't here.. we've been close to a nuclear war once before maybe just maybe we can dodge this again.

Carrie Monosmith, environmental health chief in the drinking water office, said the DEQ hadn’t received any comments. \n","Many Michigan residents feel Nestle has a lot of nerve asking for the increase, in light of Flint’s years-long nightmare over lead contamination in their drinking water. Many people in Flint still rely on bottled water for cooking, cleaning, and bathing as the government continues to drag its feet in replacing the corroded pipes. \n","Nestle representatives defended the company’s efforts to pump more groundwater, saying the “U.S. market for bottled water in general is driving the bid for more Michigan groundwater.” \n","That’s right, America. Nestle says it’s your fault. \n","If that’s not infuriating enough, Nestle gets to pump that water for free. Under state law, private property owners may withdraw from the aquifer under their property for free. The only cost is $200 in annual paperwork. \n","The interstate Great Lakes compact prohibits water diversions outside of the Great Lakes basin, but a loophole in the law allows water to be sold outside the region, so long as it is shipped in bottles smaller than 5.7 gallons. \n","Jeff Ostahowski, vice president of the Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC), asks: \n","“The issue is the privatization of a critical resource. How much is too much?” \n","For years, MCWC has battled against Nestle to prevent it from expanding in the state. \n","According to Nestle and the DEQ, an environmental review shows the aquifer can withstand the proposed increase in pumping, and that it won’t hurt its flow, levels, or temperature of nearby surface waters.

As the FBI assesses emails from former congressman’s devices, his sex scandal is once again making headlines. Joe Biden’s response: ‘Oh, God’ By Oliver Milman The Guardian October 31, 2016 As a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement, Hillary Clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is Anthony Weiner who has provided what could be the final, miserable twist. Weiner’s predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in Congress and his chances of becoming mayor of New York City , but his soap-opera-style re-emergence in the 11th hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all. His appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by Clinton’s husband, former president Bill Clinton, and by the Republican nominee, Donald Trump . On Friday, Clinton called on the FBI to “immediately” explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her, after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in July. Then, the FBI director, James Comey, said Clinton had been “ extremely careless ” in her use of a private server while secretary of state, but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation. On Friday, he said in a letter to members of Congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent to the investigation”. Republicans were quick to characterise the move as a “reopening” of the investigation into Clinton’s server, a description Democrats rejected. It was later reported that the new emails came from an iPad, cellphone and laptop seized by the FBI and previously shared by Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. Clinton’s campaign and the Obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest FBI intervention, less than two weeks before the election, with Weiner’s involvement rubbing salt into the wound. John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, said: “Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant. “It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.” Vice-president Joe Biden was more direct, telling CNN’s Michael Smerconish in an interview broadcast on Saturday: “Well, oh God, Anthony Weiner. I should not comment on Anthony Weiner . I’m not a big fan. I wasn’t before he got in trouble.” Weiner is being investigated by the FBI and police in North Carolina over text messages sent to a 15-year-old girl . In the wake of the latest allegations against him, Abedin, who has herself been a target for criticism from Republicans for some time, separated from Weiner . She has continued in her role as Clinton’s closest ally on the campaign trail. Once seen as a rising Democratic star, Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis, clad in his boxer shorts, to a 21-year-old student via Twitter.\n","UK Economy Grows 0.5% in Three Months after Brexit Vote.

A combat veteran with PTSD wasn’t allowed to fly with her service dog. So she sued. ‹ › Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for US Military Veterans. Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street Fundraising Benefited From Loophole In Federal Anti-Corruption Rule By VNN on October 31, 2016 ‘Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices’ by David Sirota AND Andrew Perez (MAPLIGHT) AND Avi Asher-Schapiro Despite an anti-corruption rule that was designed to reduce the financial industry’s political power, top officials from the investment firm BlackRock hosted Hillary Clinton at campaign fundraisers earlier this year. The cash — which poured in through a loophole in the law — came in as BlackRock’s federal contracts to manage billions of dollars of retiree assets will be up for renewal during the next president’s term. In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission looked to stop campaign donations to public officials from financial firms seeking to convince those officials to hire them to manage public employees’ retirement assets. The agency enacted a pay-to-play rule that applied such a restriction to state and local officials. The rule, however, was structured in a way that effectively exempted federal agencies from its restrictions — and it was created even though a major federal agency had just been plagued by an investment-related influence-peddling scandal. In practice, the gap in the rule allows BlackRock executives to raise big money for presidential candidates who — if they win — will appoint the officials that run the federal Thrift Savings Plan, which awards contracts to manage retirement assets for nearly 5 million current and former federal employees. The loophole also allows Wall Street executives to give cash to presidential candidates, even as those executives’ firms get deals to manage — and earn fees from — investments for the federal government’s separate pension insurance agency, which is run by presidential appointees. In all, the loophole in the SEC rule effectively leaves nearly a half-trillion dollars of retirement assets unprotected by the nation’s major anti-corruption measure. Clinton’s presidential campaign has raised more than $1 million from financial firms that are contracted to manage those assets. Two SEC spokespeople, Ryan White and Judith Burns, declined to answer questions from International Business Times and MapLight about the pay-to-play rule carveout for federal agencies. ‘Particularly Vulnerable To Pay To Play Practices’ This report is part of an IBT/MapLight series examining the extent to which corporate interests are able to circumvent federal and state anti-corruption rules designed to restrict the influence of money on public policy. When the SEC passed its rule to restrict Wall Street campaign contributions, the agency said the measure was necessary because publicly administered retirement programs “are particularly vulnerable to pay to play practices” which can end up “leading to inferior management, diminished returns or greater losses” for retirees. A study released last month validated that concern: Researchers at Stanford, Rice and Erasmus universities found that retirement systems whose overseers “have received relatively more contributions from the financial industry have lower returns.” Federal regulators ended up prohibiting investment firms from earning fees from “a government entity” — that is, a retirement system — if firm executives donate to a public official who has power to influence the retirement system’s investment decisions. The rule, though, narrowly defined “government entity”: It says the term means only an agency at the state or local level, not the federal government. “There’s no clear carve-out for federal plans, but the definition itself also does not insinuate that they are covered,” Benjamin Keane, an attorney at the law firm Dentons, told IBT/MapLight. Through legislation, congressional lawmakers could close the loophole by passing a pay-to-play law that defined “government entity” to encompass the federal government. Without that, the loophole will remain. ‘Wouldn’t Appear To Put Such Firms At Risk’ The result: Pay-to-play restrictions do not apply to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) — a $458 billion behemoth that is the single largest retirement system in America. BlackRock officials delivered over $100,000 to President Barack Obama’s campaigns, and Obama’s appointees to the TSP’s board have awarded BlackRock contracts to manage $251 billion on behalf of millions of federal workers. Those contracts were awarded by the Obama administration between 2012 and 2015. Now, with those deals coming up for renewal, BlackRock employees are helping raise big money for Clinton, Obama’s potential successor. BlackRock official Matt Mallow and his wife are listed on Clinton’s website as “Hillblazers” who have raised or donated at least $100,000 for the Democratic candidate’s 2016 campaign. Mallow hosted a fundraiser for Clinton this past February. Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton adviser, also hosted a fundraiser for her and serves on BlackRock’s board of directors. Clinton’s campaign has received roughly $100,000 directly from employees of BlackRock. If Clinton wins the election, the agency her appointees run will decide the fate of BlackRock’s TSP contracts — and there is nothing in the SEC pay-to-play rule to stop those appointees from rewarding Clinton’s donors. “Since the Thrift Savings Plan is solely a creature of the federal government,” Keane told IBT/MapLight, “contributions to the president or presidential candidates by covered executives of investment advisors to the TSP wouldn’t appear to put such firms at risk.” A TSP spokesperson, Kim Weaver, confirmed to IBT/MapLight that “the SEC has no jurisdiction” over the board that governs the retirement system. While TSP management contracts involve relatively low fees, the deals are coveted. The TSP does not publish an itemized list of the exact fees it pays to outside money managers, but documents reviewed by IBT show that the TSP pays about $106 million in annual expenses for the specific funds that BlackRock manages. BlackRock likely earns additional revenues through securities lending, in which it can lend out portfolio assets to other firms for a fee. BlackRock can also use TSP’s holdings to exert influence with major corporations. Weaver said the agency “uses a competitive RFP [request for proposal] process when selecting fund managers. The vendor is selected purely on the basis of best value and the selection is done on a fiduciary basis.” She said the agency’s presidentially appointed board members “do not serve as selecting officials on any [agency] procurement.” Federal law says the board sets “policies for the investment and management” of the TSP, and agency press releases note that the board selected BlackRock for the four investment contracts the firm won. ‘Serious Questions About The Integrity Of The Process’ The TSP is not the only source of investment business at the federal level: There is also the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , which insures the pensions of 44 million Americans and pays out benefits if private pension systems collapse. PBGC officials currently oversee roughly $88 billion of investments. The PBGC ( Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ) invests money with 23 financial firms, according to a PBGC spokesperson. Employees at twelve of those firms — including J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock — have collectively given Clinton’s presidential campaign more than $1.2 million. Goldman Sachs also paid Clinton $675,000 for speeches after she completed her tenure as Secretary of State. Those same firms donated over $870,000 to Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. The PBGC declined to disclose any information on how much in annual fees the agency pays the Wall Street firms, but there are clues about how much at least some of those firms might be making off the system. The agency’s most recent financial report says roughly 1.7 percent of its assets are in “private equity, private debt, and private real estate.” That translates to roughly $1.5 billion of such investments. Assuming industry standard fees of up to 2 percent, that one small slice of PBGC investments alone could generate up to $30 million of annual management fees for financial firms — on top of any additional fees levied on investment returns. Asked if it is appropriate for the agency to award contracts to firms whose executives make contributions to presidential campaigns, agency spokesman Marc Hopkins told IBT/MapLight: “PBGC follows federal procurement laws and regulations.” The SEC’s decision to shield the federal government from the pay-to-play rule is striking, given that the PBGC was engulfed in an influence-peddling scandal at the beginning of President Obama’s term. In January 2009, Charles E.F. Millard resigned as head of the PBGC amid accusations he inappropriately communicated with firms who were courting lucrative PBGC contracts. A whistleblower told the agency’s inspector general that Millard had been communicating with Wall Street firms seeking business from the PBGC, and that Millard refused to cut ties even after he was warned of potential ethical violations. The investigation found that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs assigned employees to win over Millard. BlackRock even tasked a former high school classmate of Millard’s to keep in touch. Goldman provided Millard with advice about how to persuade his colleagues to invest more PBGC funds in alternative investments, and the PBGC soon picked BlackRock and Goldman to manage nearly $1.6 billion in PBGC assets. The inspector general said at the time that the “improper actions raise serious questions about the integrity of the process by which the winners” of federal investment contracts were selected. The IG noted that after Millard resigned, a Goldman executive worked to help him find a Wall Street job. Millard — who was not criminally charged — worked as a managing director and head of pension relations at Citigroup until earlier this year. A few months after the IG report was released, President Obama appointed a private equity executive to take over the agency — just as that executive’s New York firm was facing questions about whether it used political influence to secure public pension deals.\n","Powerful earthquake hits central Italy for the third time.

There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths.

How the West Provoked the New Cold War October 31, 2016 The mainstream US media portrays the New Cold War as “white-hatted” Americans standing up to “black-hatted” Russians to stop aggression against NATO and to save children in Syria, but the reality is much more gray, says ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern. By Ray McGovern How did the “growing trust” that Russian President Vladimir Putin once said marked his “working and personal relationship with President Obama ” change into today’s deep distrust and saber-rattling? Their relationship reached its zenith after Mr. Putin persuaded Syria to give up its chemical weapons for verified destruction, enabling Mr. Obama at the last minute to call off, with some grace, plans to attack Syria in late summer 2013. President Barack Obama addresses the United Nations General Assembly’s seventy-first session on Sept. 20, 2016 (UN Photo) But at an international conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi last week, Mr. Putin spoke of the “feverish” state of international relations and lamented: “My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results.” He complained about “people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice” and, referring to Syria, decried the lack of a “common front against terrorism after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort, and difficult compromises.” A month earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , who chooses his words carefully, told Russian TV viewers, “My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the US military machine. Despite [Mr. Kerry’s] assurances that the US commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin) apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.” Do not chalk this up to paranoia. The US-led coalition air strikes on known Syrian army positions killing scores of troops just five days into the September cease-fire — not to mention statements at the time by the most senior US generals — were evidence enough to convince the Russians that the Pentagon was intent on scuttling meaningful cooperation with Russia. A New Nadir Relations between the US and Russian presidents have now reached a nadir, and Mr. Putin has ordered his own defense ministry to throw down the gauntlet. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses UN General Assembly on Sept. 28, 2015. (UN Photo) On Oct. 6, ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia is prepared to shoot down unidentified aircraft — including any stealth aircraft — over Syria, and warned ominously that Russian air defense will not have time to identify the origin of the aircraft. It seems possible that the US air force will challenge that claim in due course — perhaps even without seeking prior permission from the White House. Last week, National Intelligence Director and former Air Force General James Clapper commented offhandedly, “I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft … if they felt it was threatening their forces on the ground.” Injecting additional volatility into the equation, major news outlets are playing down or ignoring Russia’s warnings. Thus, Americans who depend on the corporate media can be expected to be suitably shocked by what that same media will no doubt cast as naked aggression out of the blue if Russian air defenses down a US or coalition aircraft. Meanwhile in Europe, as NATO defense ministers met in Brussels on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told reporters the US is contributing “a persistent rotational armored brigade combat team” as a “major sign of the US commitment to strengthening deterrence here.” “This was a decision made by the alliance leaders in Warsaw,” he explained, referring to NATO’s July summit meeting in the Polish capital. “The United States will lead a battalion in Poland and deploy an entire battle-ready battalion task force of approximately 900 soldiers from the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which is based in Germany.” On Thursday, at the Valdai Conference in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, President Putin accused the West of promoting the “myth” of a “Russian military threat,” calling this a “profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defense budgets … expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units, and arms closer to our borders.” Myth or not, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was correct to point out last spring that military posturing on Russia’s borders will bring less regional security. Mr. Steinmeier warned against “saber-rattling,” adding that, “We are well advised not to create pretexts to renew an old confrontation.” Speaking of such pretexts, it is high time to acknowledge that the marked increase in East-West tensions over the past two-and-a-half years originally stemmed from the Western-sponsored coup d’état in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, and Russia’s reaction in annexing Crimea. Americans malnourished on the diet served up by “mainstream” media are blissfully unaware that two weeks before the coup, YouTube published a recording of an intercepted conversation between US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and the US ambassador in Kiev, during which “Yats” (for Arseniy Yatsenyuk) was identified as Washington’s choice to become the new prime minister of the coup government in Kiev. This unique set of circumstances prompted George Friedman, president of the think-tank STRATFOR, to label the putsch in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014, “really the most blatant coup in history.” It’s time for Western politicians and media to learn their lesson and pay attention to the statements coming out of Russia. Ask yourselves: Why all this hype now?

One Jordanian soldier was also reported wounded in the incident. Unlike other recent incidents of US soldiers killed by allies, this incident was not chalked up to infiltration by rogue elements. Rather, Jordanian officials blamed the US soldiers, claiming their vehicle failed to stop at the gate to the air base and security reacted. The Pentagon was a little less cut and dry on the matter, saying they can’t say for sure if it was a “deliberate” attempt to kill US soldiers or some sort of misunderstanding. They say they are working with the Jordanian government to gather more details. US trainers in Jordan are there to train Syrian rebels, an operation which has been ongoing for years.

Search form Search From Bad to Worse : Obama’s Ransom Payment to Iran is Just the Tip of the Iceberg In his bid to pursue a legacy, Obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon. November 2, 2016 Ari Lieberman Most of us, including several democratic lawmakers, cringed when Obama inked the Iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the Iranian regime, recoiled in horror when we learned that Obama transferred $400 million to the Iranians in exchange for four American citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges. The $400 million was part of a larger installment totaling $1.7 billion, ostensibly to settle claims Iran had against the United States stemming from aborted Iranian arms purchases dating back to the Shah. Obama claimed that this was money that was “owed” to Iran and the settlement, which included $1.3 billion in interest, saved the US taxpayer “billions” because the Iranians were demanding even more at the Hague tribunal, where the claim was being adjudicated. The timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geo-political concerns. The Americans were freed only after Iran received its $400 million. The payment, which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane, was made in untraceable cash, stacked on wooden pallets. The Iranians demanded Swiss Francs and Euros rather than Dollars and a pliant Obama agreed to the Islamic Republic’s dictates. Gleeful Iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom, contradicting the administration’s adamant denials. Even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom. State Department spokesman Mark Toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the $400 million was used as “leverage” to ensure the Americans’ safe return. The White House however, quickly repudiated the State Department’s characterization. Even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration, the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the US to extortion and hostage-taking. The Iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not, every two-bit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well. But there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story. In his January 17, 2016 address to the American people, Obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the Islamic Republic but as noted by Rick Richman in an excellent article featured in Mosaic , the deal struck with the Iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the American people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement. The $400 million that the US transferred to Iran came from Iran’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) account with the Pentagon. The balance of 1.3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979. But Obama neglected to note that when Iran filed its lawsuit, the US filed counterclaim against Iran for $817 million for Iranian breaches of its obligations under the FMS program. The US could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the American treasury, courtesy of the Islamic Republic. Moreover, American plaintiffs maintained sixteen US court judgments against the Islamic Republic stemming from that regime’s involvement in terrorist activities. Those judgments totaled $3.9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. Some plaintiffs sought to recover their Judgments directly from Iran’s FMS account but their efforts were stymied by the Clinton administration. Instead, under a convoluted deal struck between Congress and the Clinton administration in 2,000, the US treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against Iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the FMS fund. The judgments would then be subrogated to the United States, which meant that judgments became direct USclaims against the Iranian government. Iran ignored the Judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs. Under US law, the $400 million sitting in the FMS account should have gone back to the US treasury, which had already paid the judgment holders. But the US treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since Obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to Iran. Essentially, the US taxpayer ended up footing the bill for Iran’s terrorism while the Iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence. Obama’s actions represented blatant disregard for the law, for the victims of terrorism and for the American taxpayer. His claim of saving the taxpayer “billions” represents the zenith of mendacity. Obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures. But as noted by Richman, the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle Iranian claims instituted at The Hague, exposing yet another lie by the Obama administration. There was one, and only one reason why the Iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is. The Iranians are the world’s foremost state-sponsors of international terrorism. They finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing. Hence, they demanded untraceable cash. The misery that we are currently witnessing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the Obama administration which provided the Iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing. In addition to the $1.7 billion in cash, Obama also authorized the release of seven convicted Iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others. But this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal. Lastly, the transfer of such a large sum to Iran in “settlement” of an alleged legal claim required the attorney general’s approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing Loretta Lynch’s signature authorizing such payment. On October 7, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) presented Lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal. Lynch, whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor, has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers’ queries. In a desperate attempt to establish a legacy, Obama pursued the Iran deal with reckless abandon, forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in US diplomatic history. The ancillary deal struck with the Iranians concerning American hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the Iranians to continue their reign or regional terror. More importantly, it may also have been in violation of existing US law and Lynch’s stonewalling only lends credence to that notion.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":95}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"c0pccyf4EHK-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602258786629,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":348,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"6754c2d6-156c-450b-9bf0-1e529390a3bc","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":467}},"source":["# failed to identify fake science.

By Christina Sarich Jordan — You’ve already heard of solar panels that can sustainably provide energy, but what about an ultra-high tech solar panel that can provide doubly-pure, twice distilled water for a family of four, out of thin air? A new start up company called Zero Mass Water that won’t rely on outdated municipal water with decaying pipes full of lead to deliver water to the ‘middle billion’ and under-served people lacking clean drinking water in the world. It will create it with solar panels and a technology that capitalizes on moisture in the air. The company’s tag line is ‘drinking water democratized,’ and it certainly seems to stand for the exact opposite world view of, say, Nestle , which has been stealing water from people and San Bernardino National Forest reserves and then selling it back to people in plastic water bottles. Zero Mass Water can deliver clean water to people in the poorest nations, with no need for piping or complicated water plants. The solar panel itself is smaller than a traditional air conditioner and can be placed in remote areas with ease. The United Nations claims that more than 783 million people currently lack clean drinking water and more than 6 million people die annually from water-borne disease. They also claim that, with population growth, we can expect a 50 percent increase in water demand; but they haven’t accounted for simple technologies which can make use of millions of gallons of water using clean, sustainable, and even simple technologies. The demand for water could also easily be met by practicing better water harvesting, catchment, and filtering. Zero Mass Water joins other breakthrough technologies like the “Drinkable Book” and experimental wastewater filters , which are trying to bring water to every corner of the world. A blog post from Duke Energy, a partner in Zero Mass’s project claims the water purification system doesn’t need an outside source of energy, so it can be placed were infrastructure is damaged or non-existent. At a recent installation in the coastal city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, a medical clinic was able to enjoy clean water for the first time without having to haul it in with trucks — an expensive endeavor. Though it rains frequently in Ecuador, there is little potable water . The project has targeted an even larger area for humanitarian aid — water-generating solar panels are being placed in Jordan. The company claims the panels will help Syrian refugees in the country, possibly aiding 200,000 people, who currently have no access to clean drinking water. If Zero Mass Water is successful in a war-torn area, their solar panels might also be perfect for the 5,300 cities across the US who have been drinking lead-contaminated water due to crumbling infrastructure and a political elite who have been unwilling to replace old pipes with new ones, along with expensive water filters on municipal supplies. When the sun can bring you energy, and drinking water, there is little need for poverty, ill-health, and reliance upon aging government and corporate structures . This invention truly could democratize water for the planet. This article ( These New Solar Panels Use Sunlight to Create Clean Drinking Water from the Air ) is free and open source.

Doug Band, founder of global strategies company Teneo and Bill Clinton’s personal assistant since the 1990s, wrote the Jan. 4, 2012, email to future Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chair John Podesta and two other Clinton aides after receiving word that Chelsea had told “one of the [President] bush 43 kids” and others about “an internal investigation of money within the foundation.” Band wrote such chatter was “not smart.” Bill Clinton and Doug Band “The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents….,” Band wrote . “ I hope that you will speak to her and end this[.] Once we go down this road….” The FBI reportedly is looking into The Clinton Foundation, although the extent and focus of the investigation is unclear. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, had previously said some of the “personal” emails she deleted from her secret, homebrew server – the subject of another FBI probe – were related to Chelsea’s wedding. Band’s email, which was revealed after Podesta’s Gmail account was hacked and subsequently uploaded to WikiLeaks, came at a time of turmoil and upheaval within The Clinton Foundation. Aside from the internal audit, previous emails show a prolonged effort to untangle Teneo from the Foundation. When Band launched the company in summer 2011, he was still employed by the Foundation and Bill Clinton was listed as a Teneo adviser. But after much haggling, Clinton’s and Band’s roles were clearly delineated: Band continued on as a personal aide to Clinton and Clinton became a Teneo client. During the back-and-forth that produced the final document spelling out each of the men’s roles, Band on Nov. 12, 2011 wrote an 11-page memo outlining how Teneo was created and how it had helped to enrich Clinton and the Foundation . In that draft of the memo, Band wrote he had “sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the Foundation.” “I am sure I have done so imperfectly,” he added. Marc Lasry and Bill Clinton In another section of the memo, which was later deleted, Band wrote about billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry as a “good example of the complex relationships a friend/supporter can have within the foundation.” Chelsea Clinton worked for Lasry, Lasry held Foundation fundraisers and Band was a paid adviser for Lasry’s firm, Avenue Capital, an investment company whose holding American Media Inc. publishes The National Enquirer. But fundraisers and jobs weren’t Lasry’s lone contribution to Team Clinton. “He has been helpful on a number of fronts, including … responding favorably to our requests to use his plane for Foundation and the Clintons’ personal purposes, killing potential unfavorable stories in the Enquirer [of which he owns a controlling share of the debt]…” Band wrote. Less than a month after Band’s Teneo memo went out, lawyers from Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP, the firm contracted to run the internal Foundation audit, emailed a draft of a governance memorandum and recommendations to Podesta, who was serving as a special adviser to the Foundation, and Bruce Lindsey, then the Foundation’s CEO. The audit draft noted substantial issues, including a Conflict-of-Interest Policy that had not been implemented, conflicts that were not disclosed in a timely fashion and board members not following the policy when they became aware of conflicts. “In addition, some interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gifts,” according to the Dec. 5, 2011, draft. Another section of the document noted that “interviewees also mentioned instances in which gifts and payments received by staff had not been properly disclosed.” There were other problems, including 1,298 “complimentary” $20,000 memberships for the Clinton Global Initiative as opposed to just 500 paid memberships. Of the “complimentary” group, “276 were coded ‘discretionary,’” the audit noted. “Interviewees informed us that there is no transparency into how the comp list is developed,” the document stated. The lawyers conducting the audit also noticed problems in the Foundation’s IRS Form 990, the tax return document of an organization that is exempt from income tax. While charitable groups are allowed to pay board members and staff a reasonable salary, none of the reasonable compensation calculations identified by the lawyers were ever done, the 990 form showed. The lawyers also wrote the 990 indicated the Foundation had a written conflict-of-interest policy that was enforced. “However, we did not find evidence of that enforcement,” the memo stated. Other problems included a “very small” Foundation Board “comprised solely of ‘insiders’”; unsigned Board minutes that “appear to have been cloned from one year to the next; “material weaknesses” in the “segregation of accounting duties, review of journal entries, audit adjustments and financial statement preparation, and lack of Board meetings.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":97}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FPuUsAJhHACG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602259528428,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":438,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"b6c82e11-d495-4e0e-a163-716fd94b15a5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":381}},"source":["# this example is more of a \"bias/ hatred\"\n","df_incorrect.at[23,\"title_text_cleaned\"]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'LOL! BRITISH WIFE Of LIB ACTOR Who Said: “There Will Never Be A President Donald Trump”…Warns Americans About President-Elect Trump [VIDEO]. Go to Article Political activist and Hillary supporter Amal Clooney traveled to Texas to warn Americans about our elected President Donald J. Trump and his tough immigration policies. Maybe she didn’t get the memo…Trump’s tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of GOP primary contenders. It wasn’t too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence, “There will never be a President Trump”. Perhaps Amal should’ve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation. Aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of American ranchers, and threatened the safety and security of American citizens living in homes in or near the US -Mexican border towns… Amal Clooney has warned that many of president-elect Trump’s proposals would be ‘violations of international law.’ Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America’s reputation under the real estate mogul’s plans. She noted that Trump’s comments during his campaign, ‘that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the US or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed — all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.’ The 38-year-old wife said America’s reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. ‘I think there’s some concern from abroad as to, “Are these things actually going to happen?”, or is the US going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,’ according to the Hollywood Reporter. Perhaps its time to put our nation’s security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us… Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: ‘When you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‘They only want jihad. They don’t believe in our way of life. They don’t respect our system,” Clooney said.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":102}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RuO_btJRF0oB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602259254289,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":416,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"64bfc123-7a59-499b-d52e-782d3c57ad4f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":191}},"source":["# This was incorrectly labled as real news\n","# but also seems like its based on a true story? \n","#https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-26/snapchat-said-to-seek-to-raise-as-much-as-4-billion-in-ipo\n","df_2016.at[9475,\"title_text_cleaned\"]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"Snapchat To Raise Up To $4 Billion In IPO, Valuing Company As Much As $40 Billion.

Facing a shortage of disposable masks and a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Afghan Ministry of Public Health has decreed today that women across the country have to wear three burqas, one on top of the other, when outside their residence. The Afghan Health Minister, Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz, announced a new set of restrictive measures for the population to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the country. Among these measures, the government has imposed on Afghan women the obligation to wear a minimum of three layers of burqas when in public, announcing fines of up to 20,000 Afghanis (262 US dollars) and 50 lashes for any violations. Dr. Feroz says this measure is meant to limit the propagation of the disease and protect women. “We know that women are by definition a vulnerable population so we are trying to protect them from harm.” Dr. Feroz explained that one burqa is clearly insufficient to protect its wearer, so that is why he decided to impose a minimum of three. “I understand that it might be harder to breathe or see under so much fabric, but if you can’t breathe, you can’t catch an airborne virus. It’s simple science.” Disposable masks have been distributed with scarcity in Afghanistan, as the country is already facing shortages of several types of medical equipment. Several Women’s Rights organizations have denounced the measure as misogynistic. In a brief press statement, the International Council of Women (ICW) criticized the Afghan government for “putting the responsibility of stopping the pandemic on Afghan women’s shoulders”. The Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (often called UN Women), Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, also denounced the measure. In a brief communiqué, the head of UN Women said her organization would remain extremely vigilant as “some governments are using the pandemic to push their own political agendas through their restrictive measures.”',\n","           'Insider Report Reveals Obama Tried Persuading Ginsburg To Die During His Presidency. WASHINGTON—Shedding new light on the former president’s relationship with the Supreme Court justice, an insider report released Tuesday revealed that Barack Obama repeatedly tried persuading Ruth Bader Ginsburg to die during his presidency. “The former president was frank with Justice Ginsburg about the potential risks of her continuing to remain on the court, which is why he urged her to drop dead while he was still in office,” read the report in part, detailing Obama’s arguments that Ginsburg could ensure her legacy was maintained by gracefully getting sucked into a whirlpool or devoured by wolves early in his second term. “Obama wanted to make the transition as easy as possible for Ginsburg by suggesting a wide variety of options for how she might want to go out, such as the numerous poisons he had brought along to their meeting in addition to a loaded handgun and a length of rope.” The report concluded that Ginsburg ultimately demurred, opting to remain on the Supreme Court after tripping on Obama’s foot and surviving a fall down 30 flights of stairs.',\n","           'Trump Family To Halt Big Bath They All Take Together Every Night During President’s Quarantine. WASHINGTON—Citing an abundance of caution following President Donald Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis, the White House announced Wednesday that the Trump family would be discontinuing its practice of taking a big bath together every night until the president recovered. “We are exercising every precaution to stop the spread of Covid, so until his quarantine is over, the president and his family will halt their beloved tradition of all piling into a giant tub for a nighttime washing,” said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, confirming that the Trumps would be unable to slosh around in the warm water and line up to get their backs scrubbed by a soapy loofah for at least the next 10 days. “We have implemented new safety procedures such as moving the basin to an open-air location on the front lawn and sterilizing all rubber duckies and toy submarines between baths in order to ensure family tub time can resume as soon as possible.” At press time, Don Jr. and Eric had reportedly taken advantage of the two weeks without a bath by getting absolutely filthy playing in the White House Rose Garden.',\n","           'Donald Trump Reprimanded For Continually Interrupting Harris, Moderator During VP Debate.

Kamala Harris and moderator Susan Page during the vice presidential debate. “Excuse me, Mr. President, but please remember your campaign agreed to the format of this debate between Sen. Harris and Vice President Pence, and your repeated interruptions are a clear violation of those rules,” Page said to Trump, who accused the moderator of trying to silence him when she asked Harris about her position on Medicare for All, and then complained that the rules were only being enforced against him. “Sir—sir, in all fairness, you’ve been interrupting quite a bit more than anyone else on stage. In fact, you’ve had more time to speak than the two vice-presidential candidates combined.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an effort to provide a more inclusive experience for worshipers, Catholic churches throughout the United States will undergo a drastic transformation this summer as they move to offer a more realistic and culturally appropriate version of Jesus than the historically European depiction embraced by the Church. The decision by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to portray Jesus as a brown-skinned Middle Eastern man clad in sandals and an off-white tunic comes on the heels of nationwide movement led by the American Leadership Council of Progressive Christian Womyn to eradicate perceptions of white privilege from the Christian faith. “For far too long we have been taught that whiteness is a prerequisite for holiness,” the group’s co-founder, Kathryn Lockhart, told Real News Right Now. While adamant that she was in no way discrediting the teachings and philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth, Ms. Lockhart argued that Christ “only became the Son of God by inheriting daddy’s power. Robert Langdon, a professor of Art History and Symbology at Harvard University called the decision by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops “a little silly,” but acknowledged that white privilege likely played a prominent role in the establishment of Christianity as a global religion. “When you have a situation where a white man living in the Middle East in 27 A.D. spontaneously launches a successful two-thousand-year-old religion, it raises a lot of questions.” With thousands of souls put to death under Pontius Pilate, experts say it stands to reason that Jesus Christ – the only Caucasian man in all of Palestine who was not a Roman citizen – received special treatment and favors which, unlike countless other condemned Palestinian men and women, allowed him to miraculously rise from the dead and helped facilitate his speedy ascension into heaven.',\n","          'Experts Say Millennials Are Inhaling Too Much Oxygen. CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – While Millennials account for just twenty-two percent of the U.S. population, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say that in the age of COVID-19, Millennials are consuming far more oxygen than the earth is capable of producing. “Current trends show Millennials are on track to inhale upwards of twenty-five tons of oxygen per year -more than twice the global average,” explained Dr. Ross E. Geller, the study’s chief researcher. Geller, who holds a PhD in paleontology from Columbia University, warned that oxygen consumption in the United States alone has risen by more than 700% since February. Due to social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders, Millennials -often referred to as the Privileged Generation- are leaving their apartments in droves, gallivanting through otherwise deserted streets and neighborhoods, and assembling in parks and other public spaces for the purpose of exercising, socializing, and other “extracurricular” activities such as vaping and dog walking. “Our planet only produces so much oxygen per year,” said Dr. Gordon Freeman, an MIT alumni and researcher who holds a PhD in theoretical physics. “Millennials nowadays have so much free time on their hands due to COVID-“19, and, as we’re seeing, the vast majority of the ‘elitist generation’ insist on being outdoors where they’re sucking up sixty to seventy percent of the world’s oxygen supply.” As scientists race to find a solution to the Millennial question, experts say older generations may soon find themselves short on oxygen. “Those in the greater and greatest generations could be inhaling close to 100% carbon dioxide by the end of the year,” Dr. Geller predicted. However, younger generations such as Z and Alpha are known to have much smaller lungs than full grown adults and therefore require very little, if any, oxygen to survive.'\n","          'France, Germany Strike Deal with DNC to Influence 2020 Election in Favor of Democratic Nominee. WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following a historic vote by the Senate last week to sanction the solicitation of foreign interference in U.S. elections, the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday announced it has struck a deal with France and Germany to influence the 2020 presidential election in favor of the Democratic nominee. “Congress has made clear that if a political candidate or party strongly believes that soliciting foreign interference in an election is in the best interest of the country, then doing so is both constitutionally and legally acceptable,” DNC chairman Tom Perez announced during a press briefing at the party’s headquarters in Washington, later adding, “We finally have a level playing field.” Under the terms of the agreement, French and German intelligence agencies will launch a joint operation designed to influence the U.S. presidential election in favor of the Democratic presidential nominee. In exchange, the DNC has provided a guarantee that the incoming administration will significantly increase funding and support for NATO. “Think of it as a kind of quid pro quo”, explained Mr. Perez who later added that France and Germany will have the unique opportunity to “heavily” influence U.S. foreign policy in Europe and the Balkans. Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, South Korean president Moon Jae-in confirmed that his country has also agreed to help influence the 2020 election. “We view it as a long-term investment in the safety and security of the Korean peninsula,” President Moon told Tapper, adding that South Korea has agreed to hack U.S. voting machines and convert “red votes to blue” in exchange for a forty percent discount on future arms sales and an increased U.S. military presence along the DMZ. Despite ongoing tensions between Tehran and Washington, a senior DNC official who spoke to Real News Right Now on condition of anonymity said Democratic operatives have been engaged in direct talks with the Iranian regime in hopes of securing additional support in the months leading up to the 2020 presidential election. “We’re still ironing out the details, but the gist of it is Iran has agreed to launch a disinformation campaign against the Trump White House in exchange for the lifting of all sanctions,” the official told Real News Right Now, continuing, “Given the significance of this election, all options are on the table.”',\n","           'Barr Appoints Special Counsel to Determine Validity of Obama’s Birth Certificate. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Attorney General William Barr has announced the appointment of a special prosecutor to oversee a Justice Department investigation into the authenticity of former president Barack Obama’s birth certificate. “This is something that President Trump and I both agree is long overdue,” Attorney General William Barr told reporters during a press briefing at the Department of Justice on Tuesday. “The president has asked me to appoint a competent nonpartisan prosecutor to spearhead the investigation,” Attorney General Barr explained. Mr. Barr went on to say that due to “the desolate state” of the DOJ, he saw no other option but to appoint himself as special counsel for the birth certificate investigation. “I cannot, in good faith, trust anyone other than myself to lead an investigation of this magnitude,” the attorney general concluded. While Mr. Barr declined to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, he said Justice Department lawyers are preparing subpoenas for a number of individuals believed to be associated with the birth of Barack Hussein Obama on August 4, 1961. “In the coming weeks we will issue subpoenas for those individuals charged with record keeping at the Honolulu hospital where Mr. Obama was allegedly born,” the attorney general stated, adding that the doctors who “allegedly delivered” the infant Obama -or their next of kin- will also be called to testify. In an official statement released Wednesday, former CIA director and acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Department of State is lending “limited support” to Mr. Barr’s investigation. “We at the State Department are working closely with our counterparts in the Kenyan government to locate a witch doctor who is suspected of masterminding the plot to conceal Barack Obama’s national origin,” the statement read. “This is about seeking absolute confirmation that Barack Obama was actually eligible to hold office from 2008 until 2016,” a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, told The Washington Times. “In the end we’re looking at the immediate removal of all Obama-era appointees including federal judges and Supreme Court Justices; not to mention a full reversal of any Obama policies and pardons that President Trump may have missed or overlooked,” the official told The Times. Although both the Obama White House and the state of Hawaii have produced copies of Mr. Obama’s long-form birth certificate, President Donald J. Trump believes both to be forgeries and has long called for an investigation into their legitimacy. “They’ve got an entire black market for fake birth certificates,” then-candidate Trump told Fox News host Chris Wallace in 2015, adding, “It’s a terrible thing what they’re doing on that island.” The Department of Justice investigation into the validity of Barack Obama’s birth certificate -along with his status as an American citizen- is expected to last at least two and a half years and will cost U.S. taxpayers upwards of $250 million.'\n","\n","]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UZahLZY4WTXZ"},"source":["new_new = [cleanText(item) for item in new_new]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ra8JIeowQB2M"},"source":["max_len = 512\n","\n","# tokenize and encode sequences in the training set\n","tokens_new = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(\n","    new_new,\n","    max_length = max_len,\n","    padding='max_length',\n","    truncation=True\n",")\n","\n","# convert lists to tensors\n","new_seq = torch.tensor(tokens_new['input_ids'])\n","new_mask = torch.tensor(tokens_new['attention_mask'])\n","\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","  new_preds = model(new_seq.to(device), new_mask.to(device)) #push to gpu\n","  new_preds = new_preds.detach().cpu().numpy()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"woaE2ed_QZZz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602263641038,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":254,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"f2cd6518-26a5-4adb-c23f-7c5692ab09e2","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35}},"source":["np.argmax(new_preds, axis = 1)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":168}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HlU9CjQlQbh0"},"source":["# Most viewed faked news stories shared on facebook 2019\n","\n","*https://www.businessinsider.com/most-viewed-fake-news-stories-shared-on-facebook-2019-2019-11\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I9Gow7halpXb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602424655162,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":364,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}}},"source":["d = {'title': [\"Trump's grandfather was a pimp and tax evader; his father a member of the KKK\",\n","               \"Pelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs\",\n","               \"Ocasio-Cortez Proposes Nationwide Motorcycle Ban\",\n","               \"Trump Is Now Trying To Get Mike Pence Impeached\",\n","               \"Omar Holding Secret Fundraisers With Islamic Groups Tied to Terror\",\n","               \"BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi’s Son Was Exec At Gas Company That Did Business In Ukraine\",\n","               \"Dems Vote To Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service\",\n","               \"Joe Biden Calls Trump Supporters the “Dregs of Society”\"],\n","     'text':['Most families of enormous wealth have a dark and sometimes scandalous, even monstrous past. Donald Trump\\u2019s clan is no exception to that rule. His grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader, his father a racist who would in the course of his life, clash with New York City Police as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and then as a wealthy real estate magnate, refuse to rent to people of color. Donald Trump\\u2019s legacy is anything but a rag to riches story. His dad kicked the bucket with $250-$300 million in the bank. The man who wants to ban all people of a particular religion from travel wasn\\u2019t born with a silver spoon in his mouth, his was white gold. The only thing more obnoxious than Donald Trump himself, is his family\\u2019s money-grubbing, bigoted history. Donald Trump\\u2019s grandfather, Frederick or Friedrich Trump, made his money from operating a decadent restaurant and hotel during the Gold Rush at Klondike in the Yukon. That\\u2019s a nice way of saying it. \"Trump made his first fortune operating boom-town hotels, restaurants and brothels\", is more accurate, according to the CBC news report, \"Donald Trump\\u2019s grandfather ran Canadian brothel during gold rush, author says\". Author Gwenda Blair simply wrote, \"The bulk of the cash flow came from the sale of liquor and sex.\" Trump\\u2019s grandfather was born in Germany, to parents who were employed by a vineyard. He moved to New York City in 1885 where he became a barber. After six years of this, Frederick Trump moved across the United States to Seattle, Washington, where he owned and operated what he referred to as a \"decadent restaurant\" that was actually called \"Poodle Dog\" in Seattle\\u2019s red light district. Interestingly, the name and concept that had already been established in San Francisco. (He named his restaurant after a dog but would later make money selling horse meat) Around this time Frederick Trump became a US citizen. A Yukon Sun Newspaper writer described his business: \"For single men the Arctic has excellent accommodations as well as the best restaurant in Bennett, but I would not advise respectable women to go there to sleep as they are liable to hear that which would be repugnant to their feelings – and uttered, too, by the depraved of their own sex\". Trump moved to Monte Cristo, Wash. in 1894, and then four years later, shortly after the Klondike gold rush began, he relocated again to Bennett, British Columbia.  Here he ran the \"Arctic Restaurant and Hotel\".  He would next build the \"White Horse restaurant and Inn\" in Whitehorse, Yukon. An article published this year by Politico, explains that Frederick Trump sold off his investments and returned to Germany in 1901, as he sensed the end of the gold rush and a subsequent end to prostitution.  The following year, he married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ in his native German town of Kallstadt.  Then he came under heavy scrutiny by the German government, The country had compulsory military service for men which had to be fulfilled by the age of 35.  Donald Trump\\u2019s grandfather waited until he was 35 to go back to Germany.  He had already amassed great wealth worth well more than half a million US dollars, or 80,000 marks.  While his town council was eager to keep Trump and his money, who billed himself as a man who \"avoided bars\" and led \"a quiet life\", other German authorities had a different plan, the Politico article explains.  In their view, Trump had relocated to Germany in order to avoid both tax and military-service obligations. The fact that Donald Trump has done so well in the Republican polls is quite amazing, as the party that we think of as conservative, would be expected to shun a man who created exploitative beauty pageants and was born rich strictly because of the nefarious activities of his ancestors. Donald Trump has often said he made his money \"the old-fashioned way,\" and this is true, in that he prospered from racism. New York Times article published 01 June 1927, related Donald Trump\\u2019s father Fred Trump\\u2019s role in a Ku Klux Klan brawl that pitted 1,000 klansmen against 100 New York City Police in Queens.  Though he wasn\\u2019t officially charged, Fred Trump was one of seven klansmen arrested during the incident.  It probably wasn\\u2019t very shocking at the time as America\\u2019s racist practices were in full swing generations after Abe Lincoln freed the country\\u2019s African-American slaves.  In fact, the mid-20\\u2019s saw a peak in KKK activity.  Donald Trump would later deny his father\\u2019s involvement in the KKK brawl in spite of the fact that it happened two decades before he was born.  Fred Trump\\u2019s enthusiasm for racist practices never changed until he was forced to do so by the law. Presidential Candidate Donald Trump joined his father\\u2019s real estate company in New York in 1971, and only two years later, the company was served with a civil rights lawsuit that was filed against the Trump organization because it refused to rent to Black people.  The Urban League got wind of the racist rental policy and actually sent both Black and White people in to apply for apartments that belonged to complexes owned by the Trumps.  What they proved, was that Black people were denied rentals across the board, and only Whites were approved.  A Village Voice article by Wayne Barrett, published in 1979, blew the lid off the Trump organization\\u2019s brewing pot of racist practices. The article explains that Trump\\u2019s reaction was to claim that the suit was a \"nationwide drive to force owners of moderate and luxury apartments to rent to welfare recipients.\" \"\\u2019We are not going to be forced by anyone to put people...in our buildings to the detriment of tenants who have, for many years, lived in these buildings, raised families in them, and who plan to continue to live there. That would be reverse discrimination,\\u2019 he said. \\u2019The government is not going to experiment with our buildings to the detriment of ourselves and the thousands who live in them now.\\u2019\"Indeed, Trump\\u2019s wild, largely uninformed and unintelligent rants are the legacy of men who walked over the backs of other Americans to gain and secure their wealth.  This may be symbolic of the American capitalist way, but it falls short of any form of greatness or real human success.  As they say, the apple doesn\\u2019t fall far from the tree.',\n","             'Freedom isn\\u2019t free, the saying goes.  And neither is the opposite of freedom, which for today\\u2019s purpose, is the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Counting legal fees for a slew of legal teams, experts, time, maintenance, and constant deliveries of Chardonnay, you and I, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, are looking at about 2 and a half billion dollars. Hope your boss can give you a raise. Speaker of the House Pelosi isn\\u2019t too keen on having that number creep out into the public eye, so yesterday, as evidenced by the filing of re-appropriation form 77-A in the Congressional Budget office, she quickly moved the amount from the Department of Social Security to cover the cost. Are you retired?  Well get ready to pay, bitch. Independent journalist Jay Garrick sped to Pelosi\\u2019s office and got a brief statement: “Well most of Trump\\u2019s voters and supporters are retired seniors.  I think it\\u2019s fitting that we ask them to help pay to fix the mistake they made.  They\\u2019ll just have to do without cable for a year or two.  Okay?  Now excuse me, I have to meet up with my liquor boy.” The price tag for this little dog and pony show seems awfully steep, especially with only a little more than half of Americans approving it.

Well, it\\u2019s no different this afternoon as the political pixie announced her intention to draft legislation banning motorcycles from use in the United States of America. The Senorita of Socialism threw out all manner of statistics regarding deadly accidents and injuries, relaxed traffic rules and tolls for bikers, as well as a not-so-veiled jab at a core demographic of President Trump\\u2019s supporters : “Besides like, what I just said?  A lot of these like, motorcycle people, okay, they\\u2019re like : ‘Ooh, look at me, I\\u2019m all old and fat and tough and I voted for Trump and smell like wet dog.\\u2019  And I\\u2019m supposed to slow my Prius down so you can like, noise pollute past everyone?  I mean some of us have a nail appointment, people.” Opposing the ban, spokesman and leader of “Bikers For Trump”, Clee Torres, also gave a statement to the press, expressing his, and his organization\\u2019s views : “I don\\u2019t know where they found this little girl with the cute little mouth, but ain\\u2019t nobody taking away our hogs.  President Trump is the best damn thing to happen to this country since Zima.” Torres added that Bikers For Trump would hold a protest against the proposal with a million motorcycle convoy in Washington, previous incarnations of which have drawn tens of participants.  Cortez may want to get herself back behind the bar where her little Punky Brewster act can make her some tips.',\n","             'During a press conference, Trump said that if he is going to be investigated, Vice President Pence\\u2019s phone calls with Ukraine should also be investigated. According to the official White House transcript as provided to PolitcusUSA, Trump said: the witch hunt continues, but they\\u2019re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it\\u2019s a joke. Impeachment? For that? When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation? I think you should ask. We actually — you know, that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also. I can\\u2019t believe they haven\\u2019t, although I heard there\\u2019s a — there\\u2019s a rumor out they want the first conversation. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation. But I think you should do that. I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence\\u2019s conversation because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They\\u2019re all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. But the word is that they\\u2019re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence\\u2019s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect. There should be no doubt in anyone\\u2019s mind that Trump would throw Mike Pence under the bus in a second to save his presidency. Trump has made no secret of his desire to build a family political dynasty, and he sees his kids Don Jr. and Ivanka as next line after he leaves office. Trump has declined to endorse Pence, and at times, has even waffled on keeping Pence as his vice president. Trump is looking to blame anyone, including people in his own administration to save his skin. Pence was always going to go down with the Trump ship. But, he never thought that it would be Trump pushing him overboard.',\n","             'Democratic freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) has been holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view. The content of these speeches, given to predominately Muslim audiences, remains unknown, prompting some of Omar\\u2019s critics to express concern about the type of rhetoric she is using before these paying audiences, particularly in light of the lawmaker\\u2019s repeated use of anti-Semitic tropes in public. Omar recently spoke in Florida at a private event hosted by Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. Over the weekend, she will appear at another private event in California that is hosted by CAIR-CA PAC, a political action committee affiliated with the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR a group that was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive terror-funding incident. Omar\\u2019s appearance at these closed-door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro-Israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti-Semitic stereotypes accusing Jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics. With Omar\\u2019s popularity skyrocketing on the anti-Israel left, it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess. It remains unclear what Omar has told these audiences in her private talks. Washington Free Beacon attempts to obtain video of past events were unsuccessful, and multiple local news and television outlets in the Tampa, Fla., area, where Omar spoke to Islamic Relief last month, confirmed they were unable to gain access to the closed door event. Islamic Relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties. In 2017, Congress sought to ban taxpayer funds from reaching the charity due to these terror links. A representative from Islamic Relief declined to provide the Free Beacon with any material related to Omar\\u2019s appearance. \"The event was closed to the media. No materials are available,\" the official said. On Sunday, Omar will hold another meet and greet in Irvine, Calif., for CAIR-CA PAC. Those wishing to hear Omar speak are being asked to donate anywhere from $50 to $250 dollars, according to a flyer for the event. The CAIR event also appears closed to the press. Free Beacon attempts to contact the organizer and obtain access were unsuccessful. Requests for comment on the nature of the speeches sent to Omar\\u2019s congressional office also were not returned. CAIR, a Muslim advocacy group known for its anti-Israel positions, was named by the U.S. government as part of a large network of groups known to be supporting Hamas. CAIR has been cited by the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, for using its network of supporters to promote an \"anti-Israel agenda.\" \"CAIR’s anti-Israel agenda dates back to its founding by leaders of the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), a Hamas affiliated anti-Semitic propaganda organization,\" according to the ADL. \"While CAIR has denounced specific acts of terrorism in the U.S. and abroad, for many years it refused to unequivocally condemn Palestinian terror organizations and Hezbollah by name, which the U.S. and international community have condemned and isolated.\" Sarah Stern, founder of president of the Endowment for Middle East Truth, or EMET, a pro-Israel group that has condemned Omar for promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, told the Free Beacon that the private nature of these events before controversial Islamic groups is very concerning. \"I just wonder what is Rep. Omar saying to a group of Islamic supporters that she feels is so secretive that she cannot say it to the American people, as a whole?\" Stern wondered. \"What is so secretive that it has to be off the record and closed to reporters? Will she say the same things in public to her Jewish voters in Minnesota that she says to her Islamic friends? What does this tell us about her openness, her honesty and her integrity?\" One veteran Republican political operative expressed concern about the secretive nature of these talks, telling the Free Beacon that Democrats must hide behind-closed-doors to appease these groups with anti-Israel rhetoric. \"Of course she\\u2019s holding these meetings in secret. That\\u2019s just how Democrats roll these days,\" the source said. \"They\\u2019re for limiting your ability to spend money on the candidates you want to support, and for secretly fundraising from Islamist groups who support them. It really puts their support for campaign finance reform into perspective.\" After last month\\u2019s Islamic Relief event, Stern\\u2019s EMET and many other pro-Israel groups penned a letter to Democratic leaders in the House demanding Omar\\u2019s removal from the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. These groups argued that Omar\\u2019s anti-Semitic rhetoric and secretive meetings should disqualify her from a seat on that committee, which oversees the U.S.-Israel military alliance. \"Rep. Omar\\u2019s presence as a keynote speaker to raise funds for Islamic Relief USA, whose parent organization and chapters have documented ties to terrorist organizations, demonstrates that she has learned next to nothing over the last few weeks when she was reprimanded by your office and by other Democrats for posting ugly, anti-Semitic attacks on Jews and their organizations,\" the pro-Israel groups wrote in a letter send to House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Elliott Engel (D., N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).',\n","             'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\u2019s son Paul Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine in 2017 to meet with government officials in connection to a business initiative. Now, unearthed records reveal that Paul Pelosi Jr. was an executive of a gas industry company that did business in Ukraine – and his mother Nancy Pelosi was featured in one of the company\\u2019s promotional videos. Journalist Patrick Howley broke the story Thursday: Paul Pelosi Jr. travelled to Kiev, Ukraine in July 2017 in his capacity as executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, a position that he accepted months earlier in February 2017. Pelosi Jr. said that he was in Ukraine to discuss a youth soccer partnership with the government. The American Mirror, which flagged Pelosi Jr.\\u2019s appearance in 2017, preserved a clip of Pelosi Jr. on the Ukrainian station following the video\\u2019s removal from YouTube. As Patrick Howley found, Paul Pelosi Jr. previously held top positions with the energy-sector companies Viscoil Group and NRGLab. On March 5, 2013, NRGLab New Technology posted two videos on Youtube. One video opened with a clip of Nancy Pelosi discussing energy-efficient technology, followed by a direct-to-camera statement from her son Paul Pelosi Jr., filmed in Washington, D.C. in 2010. “My name\\u2019s Paul Pelosi. Of course I\\u2019m on the board of Viscoil. And Viscoil is here today to talk about accelerating the future. It\\u2019s about using cars in a more efficient manner. It\\u2019s about utilizing natural resources, whether it be electricity, or gas, or fossil fuels in a more efficient way. And Viscoil is a part of that solution,” Paul Pelosi Jr. said in the video. “That\\u2019s what Viscoil does. It utilizes technology to maximize the use of natural resources, like oil and other resources,” Pelosi Jr. said. “Paul Pelosi Jr. is a member of management team of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. Paul Pelosi Jr. is interested in developing clean energy that can replace gasoline and diesel as transportation fuel sources,” read the description on the video. Another video posted that same day confirmed that NRGLab was working in Ukraine. “Walter Afanasieff, Brandon Stone, Mika Newton and other artists are actively involved in promoting the clean technology of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. For example, Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,” read the description of an NRGLab & Research Council video. Mika Newton is a Ukrainian-born singer. A 2013 interview with NRGLab\\u2019s lead technician Zeev Drori reported that NRGLab was funded by environmental businesswoman Ana Shell, who writes about Ukraine energy issues on her blog. In the interview, Drori discussed gas generation techniques in Ukraine. “Currently, Ana Shell Fund also provide finances and support to groom talented artistes like Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer who represented Ukraine in the Eurovision song contest in 2011,” reported a 2013 interview with Ana Shell, referring to the singer who brokered the S-H box deal in Ukraine. “In brief, SH-boxes are environmentally friendly generators which employs the use of poly-crystal technology to producing electricity from environmental heat. With the SH-boxes, electricity could be generated more efficiently and cleanly at a lower cost,” the interview with Ana Shell notes. Here is Mika Newton performing as Ukraine\\u2019s representative on a Eurovision talent contest',\n","             'House Democrats voted Thursday to fast-track an electronic medical records system that would serve illegal immigrants, something America\\u2019s veterans have been seeking for years. The House passed the bill on a largely party line vote of 230-184, American Military News reported. Only two Republican congressmen supported the bill — Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Fred Upton of Michigan. The proposal has yet to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate. The Democratic proposal would require the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to create a universally connected Electronic Health Records system. Part of that system\\u2019s job will be to provide information to Congress on the health of migrants who enter the country illegally, according to The Hill. The bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done. In contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement a similar EHR system for veterans. According to American Military News, veterans do have access to EHRs at individual care providers and facilities, however, their records are not universally connected to follow them through all components of the DHS agency and are unable to be accessed electronically by other providers in the agency. Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said it is important for Congress to ensure that workers at the border are doing their jobs. “As DHS works to improve its medical screening of children and migrants at the border to ensure there is a minimum standard of care, the need for proper record keeping on those screenings will only increase,” she said. Underwood said that the bill was based on her experiences touring America\\u2019s southern Border. “When I was at the border I saw busy, overworked Border Patrol officials having to keep health records on paper. I also saw how these records don\\u2019t follow migrants between facilities and transfers of custody,” she said. But critics wondered how adding more responsibilities to overworked Border Patrol officials would fix anything. “I oppose this bill because it is poorly conceived, erroneously drafted and extremely risky,” Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana said. “This bill would require the Border Patrol to divert resources from its core missions and create a new medical screening for those who illegally cross and enter the country between ports of entry.” Republican Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said in a statement that the Democratic bill was wrong on multiple levels. “Earlier this week, I said impeachment was the House Democrats only agenda. I was mistaken. They just passed legislation that will give illegal immigrants better health care records than our veterans and servicemembers. More and more they are making their priorities clear and it\\u2019s absolutely shameful,” he said. Walker noted that Democrats want illegal immigrants to have universal electronic health records faster than they are available for veterans. “The Veterans Administration (VA) will not have similar electronic health records systems in place for nine years and the Department of Defense (DOD) will not have those systems for another five years,” he said. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett said in a Twitter video that Republicans added an amendment to the Democratic bill to ensure veterans receive the same treatment as illegal immigrants under the bill. Democrats voted down that amendment, Burchett said. While a modern EHR system is set to be implemented in some VA hospitals as soon as 2020, the full modernization effort, which officially began last May, was set to be rolled out over a decade, the Military Times reported. But it gets worse, Walker said. “Additionally, the new requirements are not funded, so DHS would be forced to take funds from other agency efforts including border security, combatting terrorism, stopping drug and human trafficking, and natural disaster response,” he said. Republican Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee agreed. “If we cannot deliver a modern medical record for the men and women who put their lives on the line for us sooner than that, it is impossible to think that we could or should deliver one …  for those who knowingly enter our country illegally,” Roe said in a statement. “We should not treat anyone, particularly someone who breaks our laws, better than we treat our heroes. DHS staff along the border are doing the best they can to keep up with screening illegal border crossers and this bill will make it harder for them to do their job without actually helping anyone,” he said.',\n","             'Reminiscent of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s infamous comment that Trump supporters were a “basket of deplorables,” pro-abortion former Vice President Joe Biden made another negative reference to backers of President Donald Trump. It\\u2019s increasingly becoming the case that abortion activists are unable to provide a counter to President Trump and his supporters without engaging in hateful name-calling or violence. Last week, Sen. Susan Collin\\u2019s office says it has received threats of rape and other violence from abortion activists who want her to vote against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. And a popular conservative blogger is under police protection after she received rape and death threats because of a pro-life tweet. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden assailed President Trump\\u2019s supporters during a speech Saturday at the annual Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington, lamenting that “virulent people” and the “dregs of society” still had a friend in the White House. Mr. Biden told an enthusiastic crowd of LGBTQ rights advocates that social conservatives at home and abroad who used religion or culture as a “license to discriminate” were committing a “crime” of prejudice. “Despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made,” he argued. “This time they — not you — have an ally in the White House. “They\\u2019re a small percentage of the American people, virulent people,” he continued. “Some of them the dregs of society. And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity [and] safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.”']\n","     }\n","fake_2019 = pd.DataFrame(data = d)"],"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Fw4qeUFXvi_h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602424657843,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":384,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"9f4f0435-e2ee-4b60-bd54-6d9abfa4e893","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":288}},"source":["fake_2019"],"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Trump's grandfather was a pimp and tax evader;...</td>\n","      <td>Most families of enormous wealth have a dark a...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Pelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Securi...</td>\n","      <td>Freedom isn’t free, the saying goes.

Most families of enormous wealth have a dark and sometimes scandalous, even monstrous past. Donald Trump’s clan is no exception to that rule. His grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader, his father a racist who would in the course of his life, clash with New York City Police as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and then as a wealthy real estate magnate, refuse to rent to people of color. Donald Trump’s legacy is anything but a rag to riches story. His dad kicked the bucket with $250-$300 million in the bank. The man who wants to ban all people of a particular religion from travel wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth, his was white gold. The only thing more obnoxious than Donald Trump himself, is his family’s money-grubbing, bigoted history. Donald Trump’s grandfather, Frederick or Friedrich Trump, made his money from operating a decadent restaurant and hotel during the Gold Rush at Klondike in the Yukon. That’s a nice way of saying it. \"Trump made his first fortune operating boom-town hotels, restaurants and brothels\", is more accurate, according to the CBC news report, \"Donald Trump’s grandfather ran Canadian brothel during gold rush, author says\". Author Gwenda Blair simply wrote, \"The bulk of the cash flow came from the sale of liquor and sex.\" Trump’s grandfather was born in Germany, to parents who were employed by a vineyard. He moved to New York City in 1885 where he became a barber. After six years of this, Frederick Trump moved across the United States to Seattle, Washington, where he owned and operated what he referred to as a \"decadent restaurant\" that was actually called \"Poodle Dog\" in Seattle’s red light district. Interestingly, the name and concept that had already been established in San Francisco. (He named his restaurant after a dog but would later make money selling horse meat) Around this time Frederick Trump became a US citizen. A Yukon Sun Newspaper writer described his business: \"For single men the Arctic has excellent accommodations as well as the best restaurant in Bennett, but I would not advise respectable women to go there to sleep as they are liable to hear that which would be repugnant to their feelings – and uttered, too, by the depraved of their own sex\". Trump moved to Monte Cristo, Wash. in 1894, and then four years later, shortly after the Klondike gold rush began, he relocated again to Bennett, British Columbia. Here he ran the \"Arctic Restaurant and Hotel\". He would next build the \"White Horse restaurant and Inn\" in Whitehorse, Yukon. An article published this year by Politico, explains that Frederick Trump sold off his investments and returned to Germany in 1901, as he sensed the end of the gold rush and a subsequent end to prostitution. The following year, he married his former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ in his native German town of Kallstadt. Then he came under heavy scrutiny by the German government, The country had compulsory military service for men which had to be fulfilled by the age of 35. Donald Trump’s grandfather waited until he was 35 to go back to Germany. He had already amassed great wealth worth well more than half a million US dollars, or 80,000 marks. While his town council was eager to keep Trump and his money, who billed himself as a man who \"avoided bars\" and led \"a quiet life\", other German authorities had a different plan, the Politico article explains. In their view, Trump had relocated to Germany in order to avoid both tax and military-service obligations. The fact that Donald Trump has done so well in the Republican polls is quite amazing, as the party that we think of as conservative, would be expected to shun a man who created exploitative beauty pageants and was born rich strictly because of the nefarious activities of his ancestors. Donald Trump has often said he made his money \"the old-fashioned way,\" and this is true, in that he prospered from racism. New York Times article published 01 June 1927, related Donald Trump’s father Fred Trump’s role in a Ku Klux Klan brawl that pitted 1,000 klansmen against 100 New York City Police in Queens. Though he wasn’t officially charged, Fred Trump was one of seven klansmen arrested during the incident. It probably wasn’t very shocking at the time as America’s racist practices were in full swing generations after Abe Lincoln freed the country’s African-American slaves. In fact, the mid-20’s saw a peak in KKK activity. Donald Trump would later deny his father’s involvement in the KKK brawl in spite of the fact that it happened two decades before he was born. Fred Trump’s enthusiasm for racist practices never changed until he was forced to do so by the law. Presidential Candidate Donald Trump joined his father’s real estate company in New York in 1971, and only two years later, the company was served with a civil rights lawsuit that was filed against the Trump organization because it refused to rent to Black people. The Urban League got wind of the racist rental policy and actually sent both Black and White people in to apply for apartments that belonged to complexes owned by the Trumps. What they proved, was that Black people were denied rentals across the board, and only Whites were approved. A Village Voice article by Wayne Barrett, published in 1979, blew the lid off the Trump organization’s brewing pot of racist practices. The article explains that Trump’s reaction was to claim that the suit was a \"nationwide drive to force owners of moderate and luxury apartments to rent to welfare recipients.\" \"’We are not going to be forced by anyone to put people...in our buildings to the detriment of tenants who have, for many years, lived in these buildings, raised families in them, and who plan to continue to live there. That would be reverse discrimination,’ he said. ’The government is not going to experiment with our buildings to the detriment of ourselves and the thousands who live in them now.’\"Indeed, Trump’s wild, largely uninformed and unintelligent rants are the legacy of men who walked over the backs of other Americans to gain and secure their wealth. This may be symbolic of the American capitalist way, but it falls short of any form of greatness or real human success. As they say, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.',\n"," 'Pelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs. Freedom isn’t free, the saying goes. And neither is the opposite of freedom, which for today’s purpose, is the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Counting legal fees for a slew of legal teams, experts, time, maintenance, and constant deliveries of Chardonnay, you and I, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, are looking at about 2 and a half billion dollars. Hope your boss can give you a raise. Speaker of the House Pelosi isn’t too keen on having that number creep out into the public eye, so yesterday, as evidenced by the filing of re-appropriation form 77-A in the Congressional Budget office, she quickly moved the amount from the Department of Social Security to cover the cost. Are you retired? Well get ready to pay, bitch. Independent journalist Jay Garrick sped to Pelosi’s office and got a brief statement: “Well most of Trump’s voters and supporters are retired seniors. I think it’s fitting that we ask them to help pay to fix the mistake they made. They’ll just have to do without cable for a year or two. Okay? Now excuse me, I have to meet up with my liquor boy.” The price tag for this little dog and pony show seems awfully steep, especially with only a little more than half of Americans approving it. Let’s hope that at the very least, we get a T-shirt.',\n"," 'Ocasio-Cortez Proposes Nationwide Motorcycle Ban. Junior Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez has made a lot of waves recently with her Green New Deal nonsense and child-like proposals and speeches. Well, it’s no different this afternoon as the political pixie announced her intention to draft legislation banning motorcycles from use in the United States of America. The Senorita of Socialism threw out all manner of statistics regarding deadly accidents and injuries, relaxed traffic rules and tolls for bikers, as well as a not-so-veiled jab at a core demographic of President Trump’s supporters : “Besides like, what I just said? A lot of these like, motorcycle people, okay, they’re like : ‘Ooh, look at me, I’m all old and fat and tough and I voted for Trump and smell like wet dog.’ And I’m supposed to slow my Prius down so you can like, noise pollute past everyone? I mean some of us have a nail appointment, people.” Opposing the ban, spokesman and leader of “Bikers For Trump”, Clee Torres, also gave a statement to the press, expressing his, and his organization’s views : “I don’t know where they found this little girl with the cute little mouth, but ain’t nobody taking away our hogs. President Trump is the best damn thing to happen to this country since Zima.” Torres added that Bikers For Trump would hold a protest against the proposal with a million motorcycle convoy in Washington, previous incarnations of which have drawn tens of participants. Cortez may want to get herself back behind the bar where her little Punky Brewster act can make her some tips.',\n"," 'Trump Is Now Trying To Get Mike Pence Impeached. During a press conference, Trump said that if he is going to be investigated, Vice President Pence’s phone calls with Ukraine should also be investigated. According to the official White House transcript as provided to PolitcusUSA, Trump said: the witch hunt continues, but they’re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it’s a joke. Impeachment? For that? When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation? I think you should ask. We actually — you know, that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also. I can’t believe they haven’t, although I heard there’s a — there’s a rumor out they want the first conversation. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation. But I think you should do that. I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They’re all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that Trump would throw Mike Pence under the bus in a second to save his presidency. Trump has made no secret of his desire to build a family political dynasty, and he sees his kids Don Jr. and Ivanka as next line after he leaves office. Trump has declined to endorse Pence, and at times, has even waffled on keeping Pence as his vice president. Trump is looking to blame anyone, including people in his own administration to save his skin. Pence was always going to go down with the Trump ship. But, he never thought that it would be Trump pushing him overboard.',\n"," 'Omar Holding Secret Fundraisers With Islamic Groups Tied to Terror. Democratic freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) has been holding a series of secret fundraisers with groups that have been tied to the support of terrorism, appearances that have been closed to the press and hidden from public view. The content of these speeches, given to predominately Muslim audiences, remains unknown, prompting some of Omar’s critics to express concern about the type of rhetoric she is using before these paying audiences, particularly in light of the lawmaker’s repeated use of anti-Semitic tropes in public. Omar recently spoke in Florida at a private event hosted by Islamic Relief, a charity organization long said to have deep ties to groups that advocate terrorism against Israel. Over the weekend, she will appear at another private event in California that is hosted by CAIR-CA PAC, a political action committee affiliated with the Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR a group that was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a massive terror-funding incident. Omar’s appearance at these closed-door forums is raising eyebrows in the pro-Israel world due to her repeated and unapologetic public use of anti-Semitic stereotypes accusing Jewish people of controlling foreign policy and politics. With Omar’s popularity skyrocketing on the anti-Israel left, it appears her rhetoric is translating into fundraising prowess. It remains unclear what Omar has told these audiences in her private talks. Washington Free Beacon attempts to obtain video of past events were unsuccessful, and multiple local news and television outlets in the Tampa, Fla., area, where Omar spoke to Islamic Relief last month, confirmed they were unable to gain access to the closed door event. Islamic Relief has come under congressional investigation for what lawmakers have described as its efforts to provide assistance to terrorist group such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. The charity has been banned by some countries as a result of these ties. In 2017, Congress sought to ban taxpayer funds from reaching the charity due to these terror links. A representative from Islamic Relief declined to provide the Free Beacon with any material related to Omar’s appearance. \"The event was closed to the media. No materials are available,\" the official said. On Sunday, Omar will hold another meet and greet in Irvine, Calif., for CAIR-CA PAC. Those wishing to hear Omar speak are being asked to donate anywhere from $50 to $250 dollars, according to a flyer for the event. The CAIR event also appears closed to the press. Free Beacon attempts to contact the organizer and obtain access were unsuccessful. Requests for comment on the nature of the speeches sent to Omar’s congressional office also were not returned. CAIR, a Muslim advocacy group known for its anti-Israel positions, was named by the US government as part of a large network of groups known to be supporting Hamas. CAIR has been cited by the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, for using its network of supporters to promote an \"anti-Israel agenda.\" \"CAIR’s anti-Israel agenda dates back to its founding by leaders of the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), a Hamas affiliated anti-Semitic propaganda organization,\" according to the ADL. \"While CAIR has denounced specific acts of terrorism in the US and abroad, for many years it refused to unequivocally condemn Palestinian terror organizations and Hezbollah by name, which the US and international community have condemned and isolated.\" Sarah Stern, founder of president of the Endowment for Middle East Truth, or EMET, a pro-Israel group that has condemned Omar for promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, told the Free Beacon that the private nature of these events before controversial Islamic groups is very concerning. \"I just wonder what is Rep. Omar saying to a group of Islamic supporters that she feels is so secretive that she cannot say it to the American people, as a whole?\" Stern wondered. \"What is so secretive that it has to be off the record and closed to reporters? Will she say the same things in public to her Jewish voters in Minnesota that she says to her Islamic friends? What does this tell us about her openness, her honesty and her integrity?\" One veteran Republican political operative expressed concern about the secretive nature of these talks, telling the Free Beacon that Democrats must hide behind-closed-doors to appease these groups with anti-Israel rhetoric. \"Of course she’s holding these meetings in secret. That’s just how Democrats roll these days,\" the source said. \"They’re for limiting your ability to spend money on the candidates you want to support, and for secretly fundraising from Islamist groups who support them. It really puts their support for campaign finance reform into perspective.\" After last month’s Islamic Relief event, Stern’s EMET and many other pro-Israel groups penned a letter to Democratic leaders in the House demanding Omar’s removal from the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. These groups argued that Omar’s anti-Semitic rhetoric and secretive meetings should disqualify her from a seat on that committee, which oversees the US-Israel military alliance. \"Rep. Omar’s presence as a keynote speaker to raise funds for Islamic Relief USA, whose parent organization and chapters have documented ties to terrorist organizations, demonstrates that she has learned next to nothing over the last few weeks when she was reprimanded by your office and by other Democrats for posting ugly, anti-Semitic attacks on Jews and their organizations,\" the pro-Israel groups wrote in a letter send to House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Elliott Engel (D., N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).',\n"," 'BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi’s Son Was Exec At Gas Company That Did Business In Ukraine. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s son Paul Pelosi Jr. visited Ukraine in 2017 to meet with government officials in connection to a business initiative. Now, unearthed records reveal that Paul Pelosi Jr. was an executive of a gas industry company that did business in Ukraine – and his mother Nancy Pelosi was featured in one of the company’s promotional videos. Journalist Patrick Howley broke the story Thursday: Paul Pelosi Jr. travelled to Kiev, Ukraine in July 2017 in his capacity as executive director of the Corporate Governance Initiative, a position that he accepted months earlier in February 2017. Pelosi Jr. said that he was in Ukraine to discuss a youth soccer partnership with the government. The American Mirror, which flagged Pelosi Jr.’s appearance in 2017, preserved a clip of Pelosi Jr. on the Ukrainian station following the video’s removal from YouTube. As Patrick Howley found, Paul Pelosi Jr. previously held top positions with the energy-sector companies Viscoil Group and NRGLab. On March 5, 2013, NRGLab New Technology posted two videos on Youtube. One video opened with a clip of Nancy Pelosi discussing energy-efficient technology, followed by a direct-to-camera statement from her son Paul Pelosi Jr., filmed in Washington, D.C. in 2010. “My name’s Paul Pelosi. Of course I’m on the board of Viscoil. And Viscoil is here today to talk about accelerating the future. It’s about using cars in a more efficient manner. It’s about utilizing natural resources, whether it be electricity, or gas, or fossil fuels in a more efficient way. And Viscoil is a part of that solution,” Paul Pelosi Jr. said in the video. “That’s what Viscoil does. It utilizes technology to maximize the use of natural resources, like oil and other resources,” Pelosi Jr. said. “Paul Pelosi Jr. is a member of management team of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. Paul Pelosi Jr. is interested in developing clean energy that can replace gasoline and diesel as transportation fuel sources,” read the description on the video. Another video posted that same day confirmed that NRGLab was working in Ukraine. “Walter Afanasieff, Brandon Stone, Mika Newton and other artists are actively involved in promoting the clean technology of Viscoil Group of Companies and NRGLab. For example, Mika Newton helped to secure the rights to build a plant for the production of SH-boxes in Ukraine,” read the description of an NRGLab & Research Council video. Mika Newton is a Ukrainian-born singer. A 2013 interview with NRGLab’s lead technician Zeev Drori reported that NRGLab was funded by environmental businesswoman Ana Shell, who writes about Ukraine energy issues on her blog. In the interview, Drori discussed gas generation techniques in Ukraine. “Currently, Ana Shell Fund also provide finances and support to groom talented artistes like Mika Newton, a Ukrainian singer who represented Ukraine in the Eurovision song contest in 2011,” reported a 2013 interview with Ana Shell, referring to the singer who brokered the S-H box deal in Ukraine. “In brief, SH-boxes are environmentally friendly generators which employs the use of poly-crystal technology to producing electricity from environmental heat. With the SH-boxes, electricity could be generated more efficiently and cleanly at a lower cost,” the interview with Ana Shell notes. Here is Mika Newton performing as Ukraine’s representative on a Eurovision talent contest',\n"," 'Dems Vote To Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service. House Democrats voted Thursday to fast-track an electronic medical records system that would serve illegal immigrants, something America’s veterans have been seeking for years. The House passed the bill on a largely party line vote of 230-184, American Military News reported. Only two Republican congressmen supported the bill — Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Fred Upton of Michigan. The proposal has yet to be considered by the Republican-controlled Senate. The Democratic proposal would require the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Patrol to create a universally connected Electronic Health Records system. Part of that system’s job will be to provide information to Congress on the health of migrants who enter the country illegally, according to The Hill. The bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done. In contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement a similar EHR system for veterans. According to American Military News, veterans do have access to EHRs at individual care providers and facilities, however, their records are not universally connected to follow them through all components of the DHS agency and are unable to be accessed electronically by other providers in the agency. Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said it is important for Congress to ensure that workers at the border are doing their jobs. “As DHS works to improve its medical screening of children and migrants at the border to ensure there is a minimum standard of care, the need for proper record keeping on those screenings will only increase,” she said. Underwood said that the bill was based on her experiences touring America’s southern Border. “When I was at the border I saw busy, overworked Border Patrol officials having to keep health records on paper. I also saw how these records don’t follow migrants between facilities and transfers of custody,” she said. But critics wondered how adding more responsibilities to overworked Border Patrol officials would fix anything. “I oppose this bill because it is poorly conceived, erroneously drafted and extremely risky,” Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana said. “This bill would require the Border Patrol to divert resources from its core missions and create a new medical screening for those who illegally cross and enter the country between ports of entry.” Republican Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said in a statement that the Democratic bill was wrong on multiple levels. “Earlier this week, I said impeachment was the House Democrats only agenda. I was mistaken. They just passed legislation that will give illegal immigrants better health care records than our veterans and servicemembers. More and more they are making their priorities clear and it’s absolutely shameful,” he said. Walker noted that Democrats want illegal immigrants to have universal electronic health records faster than they are available for veterans. “The Veterans Administration (VA) will not have similar electronic health records systems in place for nine years and the Department of Defense (DOD) will not have those systems for another five years,” he said. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett said in a Twitter video that Republicans added an amendment to the Democratic bill to ensure veterans receive the same treatment as illegal immigrants under the bill. Democrats voted down that amendment, Burchett said. While a modern EHR system is set to be implemented in some VA hospitals as soon as 2020, the full modernization effort, which officially began last May, was set to be rolled out over a decade, the Military Times reported. But it gets worse, Walker said. “Additionally, the new requirements are not funded, so DHS would be forced to take funds from other agency efforts including border security, combatting terrorism, stopping drug and human trafficking, and natural disaster response,” he said. Republican Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee agreed. “If we cannot deliver a modern medical record for the men and women who put their lives on the line for us sooner than that, it is impossible to think that we could or should deliver one … for those who knowingly enter our country illegally,” Roe said in a statement. “We should not treat anyone, particularly someone who breaks our laws, better than we treat our heroes. DHS staff along the border are doing the best they can to keep up with screening illegal border crossers and this bill will make it harder for them to do their job without actually helping anyone,” he said.',\n"," 'Joe Biden Calls Trump Supporters the “Dregs of Society”. Reminiscent of Hillary Clinton’s infamous comment that Trump supporters were a “basket of deplorables,” pro-abortion former Vice President Joe Biden made another negative reference to backers of President Donald Trump. It’s increasingly becoming the case that abortion activists are unable to provide a counter to President Trump and his supporters without engaging in hateful name-calling or violence. Last week, Sen. Susan Collin’s office says it has received threats of rape and other violence from abortion activists who want her to vote against US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. And a popular conservative blogger is under police protection after she received rape and death threats because of a pro-life tweet. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden assailed President Trump’s supporters during a speech Saturday at the annual Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington, lamenting that “virulent people” and the “dregs of society” still had a friend in the White House. Mr. Biden told an enthusiastic crowd of LGBTQ rights advocates that social conservatives at home and abroad who used religion or culture as a “license to discriminate” were committing a “crime” of prejudice. “Despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made,” he argued. “This time they — not you — have an ally in the White House. “They’re a small percentage of the American people, virulent people,” he continued. “Some of them the dregs of society. And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity [and] safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.”']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":49}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MXXxMRxV2QtU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602424773787,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":731,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}}},"source":["max_len = 512\n","\n","# tokenize and encode sequences in the training set\n","tokens_new = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(\n","    new_new,\n","    max_length = max_len,\n","    padding='max_length',\n","    truncation=True\n",")\n","\n","# convert lists to tensors\n","new_seq = torch.tensor(tokens_new['input_ids'])\n","new_mask = torch.tensor(tokens_new['attention_mask'])\n","\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","  new_preds = model(new_seq.to(device), new_mask.to(device)) #push to gpu\n","  new_preds = new_preds.detach().cpu().numpy()"],"execution_count":52,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"B3kAxg6e2a_6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1602424774338,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":625,"user":{"displayName":"Iris Yoon","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--TYpyE1c4ok/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJY/MzDxs_WbqzI/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"03548712622106840275"}},"outputId":"a4bb7210-fb89-44e6-c459-e313cf892b88","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35}},"source":["np.argmax(new_preds, axis = 1)"],"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":53}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"RxssmXI182vL"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
